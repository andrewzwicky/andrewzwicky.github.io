Over the past fews months, I've become aware of just how frequently I was habitually checking my phone.  It seemed like during any small amount of downtime, I would pull out my phone just to see what was going on.  Anyone who's out in public can see tons of people on their phones, so this isn't exactly a revelation.  However, as a small step, I wanted to try to kick my habitual phone checking.

Before you read too far, you should know this isn't a diatribe about how social media is destroying everything or how you should delete all of your accounts.  If you follow tech news, it's not uncommon to see stories like this every few weeks anyway:

* [Quit Social Media. Your Career May Depend on It. (NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/jobs/quit-social-media-your-career-may-depend-on-it.html?_r=0)

Really, all I did was take a pretty simple step.  I just deleted the apps off of my phone for facebook, reddit, imgur, etc without modifying my accounts at all.  I'm still able to check facebook on my phone through the browser, so *functionally*, nothing has really changed.

The first thing that surprised me most is how quickly I adjusted to not checking things as often on my phone.  The weekend after I removed everything, I checked facebook from my phone once or twice.  Adding that tiny barrier of having to type in the website really did a lot to add conciousness to my decision if I wanted to look at facebook.

The second thing that surprised me, and what I was expecting would be the case, was how little I missed it.  Really, seeing tons of dog pictures of great, but it's so fleeting that it just doesn't stick around.
