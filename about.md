#### Who are you?
My name is Andrew and I'm a software developer, among other things.  I'm a controls software developer by day and hobbyist developer by night.  I graduated from the University of Illinois in 2011 in Mechanical Engineering (didn't catch the CS bug until it was too late).  Originally from the Chicago suburbs, I've now lived in several places across the Midwest, currently Iowa (wave the next time you fly over!).


#### Why this blog?
This blog is a place for me to share the latest things that have caught my interest.  Primarily, this will be programming ideas and approachs.  Ideally, I can explore these with a relatable puzzle or example.  By applying them to interesting & accesible topics, I hope to share my enjoyment of programming with a wider audience.  I aim for my writing to be concise and relatable for developers and non-developers alike.
