## Community
#### Mercurial
* [issue 3153](https://bz.mercurial-scm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3153) ([commit](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/0945539a3a6b))    
`hg diff -r <rev1> -r <rev2> -S` falls over if a subrepo has been removed.
* [issue 5479](https://bz.mercurial-scm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5479) ([commit](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/0e29ce16ec38))    
`hg diff --stat` gets confused by lines that start with `-- ` or `++ `.
