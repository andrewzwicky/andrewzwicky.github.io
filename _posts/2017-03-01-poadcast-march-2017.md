Hello again everyone!  This time, I'll take a break from programming and tell you about another of my favorite things: podcasts.  Podcasts are audio-only programs, spanning all types of genres.  They are typically released on a regular schedule and free (mostly ad supported) and there's something out there for everyone!  If you want to read more about them, wikipedia has your back, as always: [podcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast).  If you're new and unsure how to listen, check out this [helpful guide!](https://serialpodcast.org/how-to-listen)

In this post I'm going to share three of my favorite shows, hopefully some that you don't listen to already.  For those who are familiar with podcasts, I've tried to stay away from some of the very popular shows like [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/), [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/) or [Serial](https://serialpodcast.org/).  If you have never listened to podcasts before, both of those shows are definitely worth checking out as well.  Without further ado...

> a storytelling podcast and public radio segment about the past

First up on my list is the memory palace, created by Nate DiMeo.  Of all the podcasts I regularly listen to, this remains the one I have the most trouble describing.  At it's most basic, the memory palace consists of Nate telling stories from history.

What makes the show difficult to describe is that while the stories are historical, in my opinion, that's not what makes the show great.  I keep listening to hear Nate turn even the most minor historical footnote into captivating, very emotional stories.  The show is simple, 10-20 minute episodes, with minimal effects and great musical accompaniment.  Nate's writing is really the star of the show, and I could listen to him tell a story about anything.

> Reply All is a show about the internet and trained rats, time travel, celebrity dogs, lovelorn phone scammers, angry flower children, workplace iguanas, and more.

Next up is Reply All, created and hosted by PJ Vogt and Alex Goldman.  Reply All is a show about the internet, but it's moreso about how the internet and technology affect us all.  The Reply All team has a knack for finding super interesting stories to report on, and the stories run the gammut from funny to sad to inspiring.  Some of my favorite stories have been about the man who created the pop-up ad, and an episode where members of the Reply All team take LSD to evaluate it's effects in the workplace.  Additionally, PJ and Alex are a great pair and listening to their banter is probably worth a show on it's own.  Episodes range from 20-40 minutes, and are excellently produced.

Reply All also features one of my favorite segments, [Yes Yes No](http://yesyesnos.tumblr.com/).  The gist of the segment is that Alex Blumburg, the founder/CEO of Gimlet Media, brings PJ and Alex a piece of the internet that he doesn't understand.  The segment begins with all three stating whether they understand the tweet (usually resulting in the responses Yes Yes & No).  The hosts then go on to explain the details of a particular corner of the internet, and it is hilarious.

> A podcast where Starlee Kine solves mysteries

Mystery Show is a podcast built on a simple premise with great execution and a stellar host.  On each episode Starlee Kine sets out to solve a mystery from a friend.  What I love about this show is how mysteries that are so unique to the individual involved become so interesting.  For example, the first episode starts with this premise:
> Laura becomes a member at a video store, rents a video and attempts to return said video the very next day only to discover the store is completely gone.

Nothing about these mundane mysteries sounds interesting at first, but by the end of each episode I was completely engrossed.  Starlee Kine is the real star of the show, including having an inspiring four and a half minute conversation with a ticketmaster representative.  She brings a great sense of humor and leaves no stone unturned.  Unfortunately, Mystery Show was canceled after a short run of only 6 episodes.
