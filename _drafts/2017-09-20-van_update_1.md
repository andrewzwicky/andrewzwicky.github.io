Everyone is long overdue for an official van update, so here we go!

Last time we talked, I was in the tear-down phase, removing the old floor and interior construction from the previous owner.  Once the floor was up, I was able to get at the metal floor of the van, and I started by grinding off the old rust and adhesive that was holding the old plywood down.

It seems like some moisture had been trapped under the existing plywood floor and rusted the metal floor.  I used a grinding wheel to clear that up and then applying some rust converter to hopefully prevent it from returning.

I spent a long time brainstorming possible insulation types to use.  In the following picture you can see that there is approximatly 3-4 inches from the actual skin of the van to the inside of the bracing.  Once I put up walls, that space would be sealed off, so it made sense to take advantage of that and fill it with insulation.  The goal is to help keep the van cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  In order for the insulation to work properly, I'll have to take other steps like you would in any car (park in the shade, use a sun visor, etc.).  Any little bit counts!


My first thought was to use foam polyiso sheets, that I could bend into place and ahere to the van walls.  I'll spare you the amount of time I spent getting this to work and just tell you this was a big hassle.  The sheets are fairly rigid, so I cut them into smaller pieces to assemble into the spaces.  I tried several different adhesives and none lasted more than a day.  Lastly, those sheets make a wretched squeaking noise, so knowing that my adhesive was likely to let loose, I chose a different plan.

I ended up purchasing several batts of denim insulation, which is made from a whole bunch of recycled denim.  It has a fairly high R value (a measure of how good insulation is at trapping heat), and was easy to work with.  Compared to the polyiso sheets, it was a dream.

After the insulation was in, the walls started to go up.  I used 1/8" plywood and screws to attach the plywood to the supports on the inside of the van.  Cutting the plywood to shape was the hardest part because of the curvature of the walls, and the cutouts needed for wiring or structural elements.

As things currently stand, the floor, the ceiling, and the left wall of the van are insulated and the plywood walls are up, and the insulation is sized for the rest of the walls and the rear doors.  

What have I learned so far?
