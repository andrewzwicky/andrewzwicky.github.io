<p>Hello everyone!  Today I'm happy to present to you my second constructed crossword.  After requesting ideas from the crowd, countless iterations, and much rework, it's finally complete.  The puzzle is named "Marquee Mix-Up", and is sized as a weekday NYT puzzle (15x15).  After the puzzle, I will write a small amount about the construction, what I like, and what can be improved next time around.  This one is considerably more difficult than my first, and in retrospect includes some pretty particular jargon.  Further down this post I will include revealable hints for what I consider the most difficult words.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here is the blank puzzle (pdf).</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Hints</h2>
When constructing this puzzle, I included a few clues for the sake of completing it (or else I ran the risk of never finishing it at all until it was perfect!).  In order to not completely stump everyone, here are some clues to the more obscure entries.  Try to wait until you really need them!

<h2 class="section-heading">Construction Notes</h2>
<p>I don't remember exactly how I thought of this theme, but I like it for a few reasons.  One, it has many possible theme entries to choose from, making it easy to find good ones with broad appeal.  For this theme, I generated many possibilities including:

WARRENARONOFSKY (15)
DARRENBUFFET (12)

GARRISONFORD (12)
HARRISONKEILLOR (15)

I settled on the final entries with some help from a seasoned constructor Nancy Soloman.  Additionally, the numbers and names worked so that there was an 11/13 split and there were two pairs of swapped names.</p>

Thanks:


I'm not sure exactly how I thought of this theme, but I did like the number of possible theme entries.  I generated many many possible entries and settled on these because of the well-known actors and the division of the 11/13.  With each 11/13 pair being a swap, it should be easy to grasp the theme once one set of entries is determined.  Other possiblities included:

In retrospect, the theme is a bit lackluster, and more could be done by expanding rhyming names or swapping more letters within the names in a predictable manner.  That's a task for future puzzles.

As far as the clues go, I am fond of:



<p><i>This is just an example post to test the visuals.</i></p>

<p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

<p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
