Hello again everyone!  This time, I'll take a break from programming and tell you about another of my favorite things: podcasts.  Podcasts are audio programs, spanning all genres and formats.  Podcasts are typically released on some regular schedule and might be broken down into seasons.  They are typically free (ad supported) and there's something out there for everyone!

In this post I'm going to share three of my favorite shows.  My hope is that I can share some of the lesser-known shows with you and maybe get some more people hooked.  I've tried to stay away from some of the uber popular shows like [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/) & [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/).

> a storytelling podcast and public radio segment about the past

First up on my list is the memory palace, created by Nate DiMeo.  Of all the podcasts I regularly listen to, it remains the one I have the most trouble describing (which makes writing this post even harder).  At it's most basic, the memory palace consists of Nate telling stories from history.

What makes the show difficult to describe is that while the stories are historical, to me, that's not the point.  What I listen for is the vibrancy that Nate's writing brings to even the most minor historical footnotes.  The show is simple, 10-20 minute episodes, with minimal effects and great musical accompaniment.  Nate's writing is really the star of the show, and I could listen to him tell a story about anything.

#### Where should I start?

[Episode 55: O, How We Danced](http://thememorypalace.us/2013/07/o-how-we-danced/)  
[Episode 61: The Glowing Orbs](http://thememorypalace.us/2014/06/the-glowing-orbs/)

> Reply All is a show about the internet and trained rats, time travel, celebrity dogs, lovelorn phone scammers, angry flower children, workplace iguanas, and more.

Next up is Reply All, created and hosted by PJ Vogt and Alex Goldman.  Reply All is a show about the internet, but it's moreso about how the internet and technology affect us all.  The stories run the gammut from funny to sad to inspiring.  Additionally, PJ and Alex are a great pair and listening to their banter is probably worth a show on it's own.

Reply All also features one of my favorites segments, called Yes Yes No.  Yes Yes No is where the founder/CEO of Gimlet, Alex Blumburg brings PJ & Alex items from the internet (usually a twee) that he doesn't understand.  Typically the segment starts with each of the three saying whether they understand the tweet, resulting in Yes Yes & No responses.  The amount of exposition dumb internet memes can warrant is hilarious.

> A podcast where Starlee Kine solves mysteries

Mystery Show is a podcast built on a simple premise with great execution and a stellar host.  On each episode Starlee Kine & her team set out to solve a personal mystery plauging a friend or listener.  Who knew simple questions like "Who did this belt buckle belong to?" or "How tall is Jake Gylenhall?" could generate such captivating stories?  T

Unfortunately, Mystery Show was canceled after a short run of only 6 episodes.
