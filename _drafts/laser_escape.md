Hey everyone, I'm back to share my latest project!

I've been working for the past few months to construct a laser maze in my basement.  Yes, you read that correctly, a laser maze.

This idea was formed when I attended a bachelor party at an arcade that included a laser room.  The objective was to get across the whole room, pressing buttons a series of buttons along the wall.  Each person got a time, and could watch the others compete as well!  It was a great time, and it had always been in the back of my mind as a project idea ever since.

Whenever I mention this project, everyone always has a heist scene where a thief navigates a laser maze to get to the goods.  Just to temper the expectations, it's nothing that crazy
