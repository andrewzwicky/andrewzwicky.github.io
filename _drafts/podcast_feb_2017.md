Hey everyone, this time I wanted to take a little diversion from the usual programming stuff.  One of my favorites forms of media is the podcast, and I'm always looking to share what I've found with others.  For those who are unaware, podcasts are audio shows that are typically free and cover the entire spectrum of topics and formats.  In this post I'm going to share some podcasts that I really dig.  I've tried to stay away from really popular ones like This American Life & Radiolab, which are amazing shows, but will probably be familiar to podcast listeners.  (If you have never listened to podcasts, check those two out also.)

First up on the list is the memory palace.  Hosted & written by Nate DiMeo, each episode is a more personal take on a small slice of history.

the memory palace is one show I always have a tough time explaining, much less relaying what makes it great.  The show's host, Nat DiMeo, take historical stories and embelishes them.  What starts out as a footnote in history is unraveled into a rich, personal tale.  

[Here](http://thememorypalace.us/where-do-i-start/) are Nate's picks for great episodes to start with.

And some of my personal favorites:  
[Episode 55: O, How We Danced](http://thememorypalace.us/2013/07/o-how-we-danced/)  
[Episode 61: The Glowing Orbs](http://thememorypalace.us/2014/06/the-glowing-orbs/)  
[Episode 4: Itty Bitty Bombs](http://thememorypalace.us/2009/01/episode-4/)  
[Episode 45: Heard, Once](http://thememorypalace.us/2012/07/heard-once-2/)

Replay All is a show about the internet.

Reply All also features one of my favorites segments, called Yes Yes No.  Yes Yes No is where the founder/CEO of Gimlet, Alex Blumburg brings PJ & Alex items from the internet (usually a twee) that he doesn't understand.  Typically the segment starts with each of the three saying whether they understand the tweet, resulting in Yes Yes & No responses.  The amount of exposition dumb internet memes can warrant is hilarious.

Mystery Show is a podcast built on a simple premise with great execution and a stellar host.  On each episode Starlee Kine & her team set out to solve a personal mystery plauging a friend or listener.  Who knew simple questions like "Who did this belt buckle belong to?" or "How tall is Jake Gylenhall?" could generate such captivating stories?  T
