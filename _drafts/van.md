I have some fun news to share with everyone today.  I'll cut right to the chase, I bought a sprinter van to convert into an RV.

This kind of project has been stewing in my brain for a long time, so apologies to anyone who has had to listen to me wax poetic about how awesome traveling around in a van would be.  Now you get to endure listening to me talk about all the details instead!

My basic goal with this project is to have more location independence.  What this means to me is that I'd like to be able to pick up, spend some time out West, or down South or wherever I feel like basically.

This is a long time coming, but I have some exciting news.  For any of you that have had to listen to me wax poetic about living on the road, traveling all over the U.S., I finally buckled down and bought a van!

One of the reasons I took so long to get a post out about is that it's potentially a big change, and I'm not exactly sure what's in store yet.

As far as concrete plans go, I have none.  I have a wide range of ideas floating through my head that cover the spectrum of ways I can take advantage of the locational freedom.  Some involve part-timing, some full-timing, weekend trips, etc.

Right now, I'm concentrating on getting the van set up and ready to go the way I want.

Right now, I'm in the teardown phase, removing the old plywood floors, the metal bulkhead and starting to grind the rust out of the back.  

Lastly, the van doesn't have a name yet, so I'm currently accepting proposals for names :)
