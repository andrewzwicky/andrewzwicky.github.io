It's been about 2 months since I last posted, so you deserve an update on the van!

Last time we talked, I was in the deconstruction phase.  I'm glad to say that I've moved past that phase (at least in the interior).  I removed all the existing flooring, metal walls, and cabin/cargo divider.

Then the construction began!

I started with first grinding the existing surface rust off of the floor.  It seems like some moisture had been trapped under the existing plywood floor and rusted the metal floor.  I used a grinding wheel to clear that up and then applying some rust converter to hopefully prevent it from returning.

The next step was insulation.  My first thought was to use foam polyiso
