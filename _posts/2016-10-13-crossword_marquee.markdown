<p>Hello everyone! Today I'm happy to present to you my second crossword creation.  After requesting ideas from the crowd, countless iterations, and much rework, it's finally complete.</p>

<p>The puzzle is named "Marquee Mix-Up", and is sized as a weekday NYT puzzle (15x15).  After the link to the puzzle, there is a small write-up about the construction, what I like, and what can be improved next time around.  This one is also considerably more difficult than my first (sorry in advance!) so I have included some hints available to help everyone along.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Hints & Solution</h2>
<p>When constructing this puzzle, I spent a lot of time trying to get the fill to the right level of interesting vs. challenging.  In the process of filling in the grid, there was a lot of experimentation and re-work until I arrived at something I was happy with.  In order to fill the grid in a timely manner, I had to include some jargon that isn't very accessible.  In order to not completely stump everyone, here are some clues to the more obscure entries.  Try to wait until you really need them!</p>
<p><i>Hover each clue to reveal the hint.  If the hint is not helpful enough, mouse over the "Answer:" text to reveal the entry.</i></p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Construction Notes</h2>
<p>I don't remember exactly how I thought of this theme, but it appealed to me because of the many possibilities for theme clues.  For this theme, I generated many possibilities, many of which I can't find any longer, including:</p>
WARRENARONOFSKY (15)<br>
DARRENBUFFET (12)<br>
GARRISONFORD (12)<br>
HARRISONKEILLOR (15)<br>

<p>I settled on the entries I used for a few reasons:
<ul> 
<li>The actors are fairly well-known, which makes the puzzle accessible for more solvers.</li>
<li>There are two pairs of names.  This allows the solver to reason some information about the other clues, rather than 4 unconnected names.</li>
<li>The combination of 10/11 is more flexbile when laying out the grid, because a 15 letter clue takes up the entire grid.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>As far as the clues go, I am fond of:
<ul>
<li>FATTONY</li>
<li>PIMLICO</li>
<li>KUBIAK</li>
<li>DYNAMO</li>
<li>SOCHI</li>
</ul></p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Room For Improvement</h2>
<p>While I do like the theme, I also think it doesn't really have a whole lot of punch.  Just swapping the first letters of names is fairly simple and leaves the rest of the name exactly the same.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Thanks</h2>
