<p>Hello everyone! Today I'm happy to present my second crossword creation.  After fielding ideas from the crowd and countless iterations, it's finally complete.</p>

<p>The puzzle is named "Marquee Mix-Up", and is sized as a weekday NYT puzzle (15x15).  After the link to the puzzle, there is a small write-up about the construction, what I like, and what can be improved next time around.  This one may prove more difficult than my first (sorry in advance!) so I have included some hints as well to help everyone along.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here is the <a href="{{ site.url }}assets/MarqueeMixUp_Puzzle.pdf">puzzle</a>!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Hints & Solution</h2>
<p>When constructing this puzzle, the majority of my time was spent filling the grid with entries.  My main objective was to provide a bit of a challenge, but not exclude too many people.  You should have to work for it a little bit!  Throughout that process, there was a lot of back-tracking, and I probably had about three times as many entries that I couldn't fit in.  To complete the puzzle, I had to include some jargon that not everyone might know.  Because of this, I have provided some clues to the more obscure entries.  Try to wait until you really need them!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Construction Notes</h2>
<p>I don't remember exactly how I thought of this theme, but I thought it had enough appeal to follow through on, so I decided to come up with some possible theme entries.  The other theme entries that I brainstormed are lost somewhere, but I did manage to remember a few:</p>
WARRENARONOFSKY (15)<br>
DARRENBUFFET (12)<br>
GARRISONFORD (12)<br>
HARRISONKEILLOR (15)<br>

<p>I settled on the entries I used for a few reasons:
<ul> 
<li>The actors are fairly well-known, which makes the puzzle accessible for more solvers.</li>
<li>There are two pairs of names.  This allows the solver to reason some information about the other clues, rather than 4 unconnected names.</li>
<li>The combination of 10/11 is more flexbile when laying out the grid, because a 15 letter clue takes up the entire grid.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>As far as the clues go, I am fond of:
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><b>FATTONY</b>  This one happened to fit nicely, and I really like the level of obscurity.  For Simpsons fans, it shouldn't be too bad and for others, a potential light bulb moment.</li>
<li><b>PIMLICO</b>  Again, I think this entry is an appropriate level of obscure.  Some might know it right away, but I think a lot of people will need a few letters. </li>
<li><b>KUBIAK</b>  Gary Kubiak brings current events into the mix, and the Super Bowl connection makes it a bit more accessible.</li>
<li><b>DYNAMO</b>  I just like this word quite a bit, it's interesting and not seen very often.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Next Time</h2>
<p>All-in-all, I'm pretty happy with the result.  If I had to pick some areas that I'd like to improve the next time around, I'd start with the acronym clues.  By the time I had finally finished the fill, I had spent so much time trying to get it perfect that I just wanted to be done with this one and start a fresh one.  As I was working, I remembered this <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/quantity-always-trumps-quality/">post</a>, and tried not to spend too much time trying to get everything perfect.</p>

<p>This time around, I didn't think everything was quite up to snuff to submit for potential publication, but my goal is to get something published in 2017.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Thanks</h2>
<p>Thanks to Nancy Salomon and Jeff Chen, two experienced constructors who gave me very helpful feedback.  Thanks to everyone who submitted words.  I'll try to squeeze them in future puzzles.</p>
