I've been sitting on some exciting news for a little while, and I finally got around to writing this up to share with everyone.  About a month ago, I bought a 2010 Sprinter van to convert into an RV!

This project has been stewing in my brain for a long time, and it was high time to take some action.  Apologies to anyone who has listened to me wax poetic about how awesome traveling around in a van would be.  Now you get to endure listening to me talk about the gory details instead.

My basic goal with this project is to be less tied down. Ideally, I'd like to be able to pick up, spend some time out West, or down South or wherever I feel like.  I've got friends across the country that I don't see nearly enough as is.  That could mean weekend trips, month long trips, or full-timing.  I'm going to let this evolve and see where the right balance is.  I don't have any plans to sell my house or car quite yet.

As far as the actual van, I'm in the process of breaking it down.  It came with some plywood flooring and a metal divider between the cargo area and the passenger area.  I've taken that all out, as well as removed some old metal sheeting and wiring from the back.  It's down to bare metal, so I'm grinding the rust out of the back currently.  Here's a picture of it when I first got it:

And with the plywood floor up:

My plan so far is to include the following:

* 12V Power system (batteries)
* Refrigerator
* Freshwater storage / sink
* Gray water tank (possibly)
* Camp stove

I do not plan on having the following right away (or ever):

* Bathroom
* Shower
* TV
* Microwave

As far as arrangements, I'm modeling out the inside now.  I'd like to have the plan fairly squared away before I get too far into construction.  Next steps right now is to get insulation on the floor and walls and install flooring.

I really didn't (and still don't) have a plan, but I can say for certain that actually purchasing the van threw a huge amount of churn and insecurity into my head about the project.  Thankfully I have rational friends and family, and I'm really excited to see where this goes.

Lastly, the van doesn't have a name yet, so I'm currently accepting name proposals ☺️
