Friday (3/10):
Deleted reddit, facebook, imgur, feedly

wanted to break habitual checking.  Noticed absence in morning, right when I wake up, downtime, waiting rooms, etc.

Monday 3/13:
I can definitely tell that there is still a habit to break out the phone.  Over the weekend, I checked facebook once through the broswer, scrolled for a bit to see what was going on, then exited out.  Definitely an improvment over have the app directly accessible.

Since deleting the apps, I have gone on facebook a few times (maybe 3).
