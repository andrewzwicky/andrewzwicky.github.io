#### Who are you?
My name is Andrew and I'm a software developer, among other things.  I'm a software developer on controls software by day and hobbyist developer by night.  I graduated from the University of Illinois in 2011 in Mechanical Engineering (didn't catch the CS bug until it was too late).  


#### Why this blog?
This blog is my space to bring interesting programming topics and applications to an audience that might not be exposed otherwise.  I aim for my writing to be clear and concise and widely understandable by a non-developer audience.  This will also serve as a portfolio of side-projects and technical writing.
