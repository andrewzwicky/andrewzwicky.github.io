#### Who are you?
My name is Andrew and I'm a software developer, among other things.  I'm a controls software developer by day and hobbyist developer by night.  I graduated from the University of Illinois in 2011 in Mechanical Engineering (didn't catch the CS bug until it was too late).  Originally from the Chicago suburbs, I've now lived in several places across the Midwest.


#### Why this blog?
This blog is a place for me to share the latest things that have caught my interest.  Primarily, this will be programming ideas and approachs.  Ideally, I can explore these with a relatable puzzle or axample.  By applying them to interesting topics, I hope to share my enjoyment of programming with a wider audience.  I aim for my writing to be concise and relatable for developers and non-developers alike.  Additionally, documentation for my side-projects will live here as well.


#### What about non-programming stuff?
Absolutely!  Outside of progamming, I really enjoy listening to podcasts and reading.
